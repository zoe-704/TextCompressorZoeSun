| Dec 4  |  10-1130pm  | I spent more time brainstorming a way to actually compress text. I think that directly compressing the most common words would be helpful, but I'm not too sure yet. I think that finding the frequency of each word somehow would be really useful to compress, so I'm using a hashmap for that. |

I then began working on the expansion function and mapping out what i need to do for it. |
