| Dec 4 | 10-1130pm | I spent more time brainstorming a way to actually compress text. I think that directly compressing the most common words would be helpful, but I'm not too sure yet. I think that finding the frequency of each word somehow would be really useful to compress, so I'm using a hashmap for that. |
