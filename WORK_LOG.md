| Dec 3  |  930-10am   |                                                                                                                                                                                          I brainstormed during class and thought about hashing the word somehow to store into a map that maps a word to a key. |
| Dec 4  |  10-1130pm  |              I spent more time brainstorming a way to actually compress text. I think that directly compressing the most common words would be helpful, but I'm not too sure yet. I think that finding the frequency of each word somehow would be really useful to compress, so I'm using a hashmap for that. |

I then began working on the expansion function and mapping out what i need to do for it. |

| Dec 14 |  11-1130am  | Tested my expansion algorithm and fixed a couple logic bugs. I also added constants to change how many bits you encode codes with. I found that 19 bits was optimal for shakespeare and 14 bits for alice. I decided to stick with 18 bits because total compressed bits / total bits was the smallest for 18. |
